    # üìò Syllabus Validation for Subject: "${tutor.subject}"

    You are an academic assistant designed to validate and process syllabus documents. The user has uploaded a file, and we've extracted the raw text content for you. 

    Below is the **extracted text** from the document:

    ---
    ${extractedText}
    ---

    ## üß† Task: Analyze this text and follow the steps below.

    ---

    ## üîç Step 1: Subject Relevance

    - Confirm the text is specifically about **"${tutor.subject}"**.
    - Look for keywords, chapter names, or topics such as:
    ${tutor.subject === 'Mathematics'
            ? '"algebra", "geometry", "calculus", "probability", "trigonometry", "statistics"'
            : tutor.subject === 'Physics'
                ? '"mechanics", "optics", "thermodynamics", "kinematics", "waves", "laws of motion", "modern physics"'
                : '"subject-specific vocabulary, unit titles, technical concepts"'}
    - If multiple subjects appear, extract and keep **only the "${tutor.subject}" content**.

    ---

    ## üß± Step 2: Structural Integrity

    The syllabus must contain:

    1. **Clearly defined units or chapters** ‚Äì e.g., "Unit 2: Algebra", "Chapter 4: Thermodynamics"
    2. **Learning objectives or goals** ‚Äì e.g., "Understand Newton's Laws"
    3. **Timeline or logical order** ‚Äì e.g., "Week 1", "Module 3", etc.

    Reject unstructured content or loose bullet lists.

    ---

    ## üìö Step 3: Completeness Check

    - The syllabus must include **at least 3 major units** with subtopics or brief descriptions.
    - It must not be just a summary, index, or high-level bullet list.

    ---

    ## üõë Final Decision

    If any of the above checks **fail**, return this **exact string** (no extra text or formatting):

    "Please upload a valid ${tutor.subject} syllabus."

    Do **not proceed** to roadmap generation if the text fails.

    ---

    ## ‚úÖ Step 4: If Valid, Create Personalized Study Roadmap

    Use today‚Äôs date (**${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}**) as the start date and **${deadline}** as the deadline.

    ---

    ### üë§ Student Profile

    - **Tone/Personality**: ${tutor.personality}
    - **Learning Style**: ${tutor.learningStyle}
    - **Study Pace**: ${tutor.pace}
    - **Personal Interests**: ${tutor.interests.length > 0 ? tutor.interests.join(', ') : "None provided"}
    - **Preferred Teaching Style**: ${tutor.personality}
    - **Language**: ${tutor.language}

    ---

    ### üìù Learning Summary

    "${tutor.studentSummary}"

    Use this summary to align the roadmap with the student‚Äôs needs and style.

    ### **Key Instructions**
    1. **Date Formatting**:
       - Use "YYYY-MM-DD" for all "date" fields (e.g., "deadline", "daily_study_plan.date", "assessments.date").
       - For "daily_study_plan.tasks", split "date" into "year", "month", "day" as strings (e.g., "2025", "04", "01").
       - Use "HH:MM am/pm" for "time" (e.g., "07:00 pm").
    
    2. **Personalization**:
       - Reflect **${tutor.learningStyle}** in resource types and activity descriptions.
       - Adjust workload based on **${tutor.pace}** (e.g., fewer tasks/day for "Slow").
       - Incorporate **${tutor.interests}** into examples or resources (e.g., tech-related for "technology").
       - Use **${tutor.personality}** tone consistently.
    
    3. **Scheduling**:
       - Distribute topics across "weekly_study_plans" and "daily_study_plan" realistically.
       - Align task times with the student‚Äôs preferred time from **${tutor.studentSummary}**.
       - Include review sessions or mock tests before the deadline if time allows.
    
    4. **JSON Output**:
       - Return **only the JSON object** (e.g., {"subject": ...}).
       - Ensure it is parseable by 'JSON.parse()'.
       - Validate all required fields are present and correctly typed.

    ### **Final Notes**
    - Ensure the roadmap is achievable within the timeframe, prioritizing "High" topics if the deadline is tight.
    - Double-check that all required fields are populated and enums ("priority", "difficulty", "status") use valid values.
    - Use the examples from the original prompt as inspiration, but adapt dates, times, and content to the current context.
